#Packages for linear (and non linear) algebra#

* `CppNumericalSolvers` Solvers for optimization of a given cost functional. A modified copy of that in  `git@github.com:PatWie/CppNumericalSolvers.git`

* `IML_Eigen` Iterative solvers for linear systems of equations. My
  porting to Eigen of the template class of `IML++`.
  
* `MatrixData` A few matrices in Matrix Market format, useful to test the code contained  in `IML_Eigen`

* `MatrixMarketReadersMatlab` As the name says.

* `redsvd-h` The C++ porting (using Eigen as Matrix Library) of
  redsvd, a tool for reduced rank approximation of a Matrix using
  random matrices. A modified version of the one in
  `git@github.com:ntessore/redsvd-h.git`.
  
* `spectra` Efficient solvers for estimating the spectra of (possibly
  large) sparse matrices. A modification of that in
  `https://github.com/yixuan/spectra.git`.

* `Utilities` Some various utilities.

*See also the README files in each folder.*
